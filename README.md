## How to Play:  
1. Roll the Dice to determine if player 1 (white) or player 2 (blue) goes first. (Bottom right, dice1 = player1 and dice2 = player2)  
2. This initial dice roll will be used for the first turn depending on who rolled the higher value. Click a checker on the board to move it. The allowed moves will be highlighted in red, and the checker chosen will be highlighted in green. To de-select a checker, click the tile again.
3. Once you have completed your move, it is the opposing player's turn, so they must roll the dice and move their checkers as well.  
4. Have Fun! If you want more information about the game, you can open up a rulesheet ingame by pressing the "Rules" button located on the bottom panel.  

## Extra Features:  
1. Save/Load Game Feature:  
a. You can only save after the initial roll (to determine who goes first) and before someone wins the game  
b. You can only load games before the initial roll (to determine who goes first)  
Example Save File: bearingoff.txt  
2. Intuitive UI  
a. Very useful UI to indicate where the player can move during their turn (highlighting checkers when moving, and when a person has checkers on the bar)  
b. Logger at top to indicate which player's turn it is (as well as dice color)  
c. Rules page that can be viewed while playing the game
