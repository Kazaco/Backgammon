        <h1>Backgammon Rules</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
        <p>The object of the game is move all your checkers into your own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all of their checkers wins the game.</p>

        <h2>Movement of Checkers</h2>
        <p>To start the game, each player throws a single die. 
            This determines both the player to go first and the numbers to be played. 
            If equal numbers come up, then both players roll again until they roll different numbers. 
            The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers according to the numbers showing on both dice. 
            After the first roll, the players throw two dice and alternate turns.
            The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player is to move his checkers. 
            The checkers are always moved forward, to a lower-numbered point. The following rules apply:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A checker may be moved only to an open point, one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. </li>
            <li>The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, 
                he may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open point, 
                or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an open point, but only if the intermediate point 
                (either three or five spaces from the starting point) is also open.</li> 
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>A player who rolls <strong>doubles</strong> plays the numbers shown on the dice twice. 
                A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use, and he may move any combination 
                of checkers he feels appropriate to complete this requirement.  </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Hitting and Entering</h2>
        <p>
            A point occupied by a single checker of either color is called a blot. 
            If an opposing checker lands on a blot, the blot is hit and placed on the bar.
            Any time a player has one or more checkers on the bar, his first obligation is to enter those 
            checker(s) into the opposing home board. A checker is entered by moving it to an open point corresponding 
            to one of the numbers on the rolled dice.For example, if a player rolls 4 and 6, he may enter a checker onto 
            either the opponent’s four point or six point, so long as the prospective point is not occupied by two or more 
            of the opponent’s checkers.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If <strong>neither of the points is open</strong>, the player loses his turn. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Bearing Off</h2>
        <p>
            Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home board, he may commence bearing off. 
            A player bears off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker 
            resides, and then removing that checker from the board. Thus, rolling a 6 permits the player to remove 
            a checker from the six point.If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, the player must 
            make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered 
            points, the player is permitted (and required) to remove a checker from the highest point on which one of 
            his checkers resides.
